# Hilbert–Pólya dynamical structure exploration

This directory is the continuously updated Hénon-dynamics research track of
the Hilbert–Pólya Structure Exploration project.  It starts from the original
area-preserving Hénon manuscript, but treats every proposed bridge to
arithmetic or spectral structure as a hypothesis to be tested rather than an
assumption.

The working style is breadth-first:

```text
candidate dynamics
    -> exact periodic/symbolic structure
    -> weighted dynamical zeta
    -> transfer/operator test
    -> Route-A or Route-B decision
```

Positive constructions, obstructions, and well-scoped failures are all kept.
Chronological products are preserved in non-autonomous systems; they are not
replaced by averaged transition matrices.

## Latest result: HCS-C14

The latest paper changes dynamical category from a smooth Hénon map to an
autonomous skew product of noncommuting automorphisms of the dyadic
two-solenoid.  It retains a genuine shift clock and proves that changing only
the chronological order of an equal-incidence period-five word changes the
analytic type of its return zeta function.

Reproduce its frozen artifacts with:

```bash
cd s_integer_solenoid_chronology_zeta
python code/solenoid_zeta.py --max-period 20 --parity-period 12 --tower-level 8
python code/independent_check.py --max-period 12
python -m unittest discover -s code -p 'test_*.py' -v
cd results && sha256sum -c ARTIFACT_HASHES.sha256
```

## Mirrored-data boundary

The related `henon_weighted_zeta` source, scripts, final paper, and compact
R058/R059 certificates are mirrored here.  Its large historical R052--R061
matrix/NPZ sweeps are deliberately not mirrored; the complete historical test
suite expects those local data assets and is therefore not a code-only CI
target.  The data-independent source tests can be run with:

```bash
cd docs/related_programs/henon_weighted_zeta
python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_controls.py tests/test_geometry.py tests/test_homotopy.py \
  tests/test_interval_cover.py tests/test_operator.py tests/test_orbits.py \
  tests/test_precision.py tests/test_subdivided_cover.py tests/test_zeta.py
```

At the current snapshot this subset passes 45/45 tests.  Artifact-dependent
claims should instead be checked against the compact certificates and hashes
retained by their consuming theorem packages.

## Update discipline

When a research round reaches a meaningful stage:

1. add or update its project-level `README.md`;
2. keep exact code, compact result certificates, and independent checks;
3. append rather than overwrite formal Route-A evaluation records;
4. update the candidate, obstruction, and related-program registries;
5. state explicitly what is proved, what failed, and what remains open.

Regenerable caches, nested Git metadata, TeX auxiliary files, and bulky raw
array dumps are intentionally excluded from synchronization.  Papers,
source, compact certificates, and audit records remain versioned.

Last synchronized research snapshot: **2026-08-06**.
