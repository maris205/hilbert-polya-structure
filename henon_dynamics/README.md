# Hilbert–Pólya dynamical structure exploration

This directory is the continuously updated Hénon-dynamics research track of
the Hilbert–Pólya Structure Exploration project.  It starts from the original
area-preserving Hénon manuscript, but treats every proposed bridge to
arithmetic or spectral structure as a hypothesis to be tested rather than an
assumption.

The working style is breadth-first:

```text
candidate dynamics
    -> exact periodic/symbolic structure
    -> weighted dynamical zeta
    -> transfer/operator test
    -> Route-A or Route-B decision
```

Positive constructions, obstructions, and well-scoped failures are all kept.
Chronological products are preserved in non-autonomous systems; they are not
replaced by averaged transition matrices.

## Latest result: HCS-C20

The ordered-edge lift of the adopted period-seven septic is now proved to be
the connected genus-eight \(D_7\) splitting curve.  Its rotation quotient is
the genus-two discriminant curve
\[
B:w^2=Q_6(\sigma),
\]
its scalar reflection quotient is the genus-three HCS-C19 curve, and the
cyclic map \(E\to B\) is unramified of degree seven.

Hénon chronology induces a Rosati-self-adjoint correspondence on
\(\operatorname{Jac}(C)\) with exact minimal polynomial
\[
T^3+T^2-2T-1,
\]
so \(\mathbb Q(\zeta_7+\zeta_7^{-1})\) embeds in its rational endomorphism
algebra.  The quotient-character identity gives
\[
\operatorname{Jac}(E)\sim_{\mathbb Q}
\operatorname{Jac}(B)\times\operatorname{Jac}(C)^2.
\]

A selected-prime theorem closes HCS-C19's arithmetic caveat at
\(p=5,11,13\).  Nontrivial vertical \(C_7\) inertia would force
\(\mu_7\subset\mathbb F_p\), purity extends the cover finite étale, and a
two-chart normalization plus irreducible specializations identifies the
smooth quotient with the normalization of the plane septic after reduction.
Independent extension-field enumeration then certifies the displayed
\(L_C\) and \(L_E=L_B L_C^2\) as genuine local Hasse--Weil factors at exactly
those primes.

The Route-A verdict remains
**(A1_WEAK, A2_FAIL, A3_FAIL, A4_FORMAL_HINT)**.  The result supplies real
arithmetic and self-adjoint structure, but it is locked to \(n=7\);
ordinary cohomology adds no eigenvalues beyond \(B\) and two copies of \(C\),
and no cross-period Fredholm determinant or Riemann divisor exists.

## Predecessor result: HCS-C19

The latest paper returns to the original area-preserving Hénon program and
studies a corrected period-seven chiral coordinate equation.  An exact
\(\mathbb F_{103}\) orbit witness shows that the literal constant term in
Endler--Gallas Eq. (16) is inconsistent with the stated dynamics; the project
therefore records an adopted placement of the constant that passes that
fibre.  No official publisher erratum is claimed.

\[
\operatorname{Disc}_xP=(4\sigma-9)^2Q_6(\sigma)^3.
\]

The six roots of the irreducible sextic \(Q_6\) each support three simple
ramification points.  The remaining finite discriminant point is an ordinary
node and infinity splits into seven unramified normalization branches.
Riemann--Hurwitz and an independent plane-septic delta calculation both give
\(g=3\) for the explicit characteristic-zero septic.  Exact affine counts and
a frozen branch correction at \(p=5,11,13\) produce three reciprocal
degree-six candidate numerators; a second implementation reproduces all
counts and a sealed \(p=5,r=4\) prediction.  Simultaneous normalization and
good reduction at these primes were left open in HCS-C19 and are closed by
HCS-C20 above.

The decisive generic calculation takes the gcd in \(y\) of
\(P(\sigma,y)\) and \(P(\sigma,a-y^2-x)\) over
\(\mathbb Q(\sigma)[x]/(P)\).  It has degree two, and its neighbor roots sum
to \(a-x^2\).  Exact nondegeneracy plus prime-degree monodromy force one
seven-cycle.  The 14 ordered edges therefore carry

\[
\tau(x,y)=(a-x^2-y,x),\qquad \tau^7=1,
\]

together with time reversal.  This generically certifies the adopted septic
as a true Hénon period-seven carrier and restores the orientation lost on the
scalar genus-three quotient.

The Hilbert--Pólya verdict is exploratory but still far from positive:
**(A1_WEAK, A2_FAIL, A3_FAIL, A4_FORMAL_HINT)**.  Hénon time is now genuine,
but period remains fixed at seven and the scalar candidate Frobenius rows are
not time sectors upstairs.  The next large step is the geometry of the
ordered-edge cover and joint
\(\#\operatorname{Fix}(\operatorname{Frob}_p^r\tau^s)\) data without
orientation averaging.

## Mirrored-data boundary

The related `henon_weighted_zeta` source, scripts, final paper, and compact
R058/R059 certificates are mirrored here.  Its large historical R052--R061
matrix/NPZ sweeps are deliberately not mirrored; the complete historical test
suite expects those local data assets and is therefore not a code-only CI
target.  The data-independent source tests can be run with:

```bash
cd docs/related_programs/henon_weighted_zeta
python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_controls.py tests/test_geometry.py tests/test_homotopy.py \
  tests/test_interval_cover.py tests/test_operator.py tests/test_orbits.py \
  tests/test_precision.py tests/test_subdivided_cover.py tests/test_zeta.py
```

At the current snapshot this subset passes 45/45 tests.  Artifact-dependent
claims should instead be checked against the compact certificates and hashes
retained by their consuming theorem packages.

## Update discipline

When a research round reaches a meaningful stage:

1. add or update its project-level `README.md`;
2. keep exact code, compact result certificates, and independent checks;
3. append rather than overwrite formal Route-A evaluation records;
4. update the candidate, obstruction, and related-program registries;
5. state explicitly what is proved, what failed, and what remains open.

Regenerable caches, nested Git metadata, TeX auxiliary files, and bulky raw
array dumps are intentionally excluded from synchronization.  Papers,
source, compact certificates, and audit records remain versioned.

Last synchronized research snapshot: **2026-08-08**.
